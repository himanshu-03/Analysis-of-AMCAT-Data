# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Hypothesis Testing on AMCAT Dataset

## üìã Project Overview
This project entails conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the AMCAT dataset, focusing on understanding various features and their relationships with the target variable, Salary. Additionally, hypothesis testing is performed to investigate specific claims, such as the relationship between education and earning potential, and to test the claim made in a Times of India article regarding the earning potential of Computer Science Engineering graduates.

## üìä Key Features
- **EDA on AMCAT Dataset:** An open-ended EDA is conducted to explore the AMCAT dataset, analyzing various features and their distributions, correlations, and relationships with the target variable, Salary.
- **Exploration of Gender and Specialization Preferences:** The relationship between gender and specialization preferences among individuals in the AMCAT dataset is explored to understand potential patterns and trends.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistical tests are applied to validate hypotheses and investigate specific claims, including the earning potential of Computer Science Engineering graduates and the relationship between education and earning potential.
